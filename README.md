# Linear Regression


## Linear Regression from scratchLinear Regression from scratch

- Developed a linear regression model using NumPy library from scratch to predict a target variable.
- Implemented L1 and L2 regularization parameters in the model to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
- Developed a closed-form solution function to solve for the optimal parameters of the linear regression model.
- Designed a plotting function to visualize the changes in cost over the training iterations.
- Added support for stochastic and mini-batch gradient descent optimization techniques for improved model training efficiency.
